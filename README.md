# Users.Projects
### Application setup on local machine
    Step 1. Clone the repo and navigate to the Users.Projects.Api folder. Open the Users.Projects.Api.sln file 
      and run the project.
    Step 2. Open with VS Code my other repository with the frontend project located 
      in the "Users.Projects.Ng/users-projects" folder run "npm install" to install all dependencies and then run the "ng serve -o" command in the terminal. 
      This will serve the front end project and will be opened on port 4200.
    Step 3. Should be ready to use!
